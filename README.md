# Prediction Using Unsupervised Machine Learning  

This project applies **Unsupervised Machine Learning** techniques to identify hidden patterns and natural groupings within a dataset.  
The main goal is to use clustering algorithms to classify data points without predefined labels and visualize the results for better understanding.  

---

## Project Overview  
The objective of this project is to perform **data analysis and clustering** using unsupervised learning methods.  
It involves cleaning the dataset, finding optimal cluster counts, applying algorithms like **K-Means**, and visualizing the cluster distribution.  

---

## Data Preprocessing Steps  
- Imported and explored the dataset  
- Handled missing or duplicate values  
- Normalized features for consistent scaling  
- Selected key variables relevant for clustering  
- Visualized feature relationships before model fitting  

---

## Machine Learning Approach  
- **Algorithm Used:** K-Means Clustering  
- **Steps Followed:**  
  - Determined the optimal number of clusters using the **Elbow Method**  
  - Applied **K-Means** to group data points  
  - Visualized the clusters using scatter plots and color-coded regions  
- **Evaluation:** Visual inspection and interpretation of cluster separations

## Insights & Outcomes  
- Data points successfully grouped into distinct clusters  
- Clear visualization of patterns based on feature similarities  
- Each cluster represents a unique group or trend identified within the dataset  
- Prepared the data for potential supervised learning models in the next phase
